## Purpose of Instrument Approaches
- Allows safe descent below the MSA in adverse weather conditions
- Useful in establishing a stable descent profile
- Can be runway aligned or enable descent to the circling area

### Descending Below the MSA
- Must only descend below the MSA once past the IAF and established on the procedure
- ATC may provide vectors and facilitate descent on the MVA to commence lower than the MSA
- All ground-based navaids must be tuned and identified prior to descent below the MSA/passage of the IAF

## 3D Approaches (ILS/GLS)
- Provide lateral and vertical guidance
- ILS is tuned into VHF Nav radio, GLS is entered through FMS or other GNSS interface
- When ATC providing vectors to intercept LOC/FAC, expect to be established at least 2nm prior to the FAP
- Minima is 'Decision Altitude', based on height (either radio height or baro altitude)

## 2D Approaches
- Provide lateral guidance only
- Vertical profile must be maintained manually by pilot
- Minima based on altitude (Minimum Descent Altitude) and missed approach commenced from Missed Approach Point
- Most approaches follow a 3 degree profile
    - rule of thumb for 320ft/1nm and 1000ft/3nm

### RNP
- Must commence from IAF (not IF)
- Uses GNSS or other area-based navigation system
- Ensure RAIM available prior to approach

### LOC
- CDI deflection of localiser

### VOR
- CDI deflection of VOR radial
- May involve reversal procedure

### NDB
- Azimuth deflection of ADF needle
- May involve reversal procedure

## Circling Approaches
- Requirements when circling
- Definition of circling area
- When you can circle in a No Circling Area

## Missed Approaches
- When a missed approach must be commenced (from AIP)
- Guidance on how to conduct missed approach if tracking references an aid (note about intercepting, etc)
