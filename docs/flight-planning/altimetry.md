## Transition Layer
- Transition altitude and level
- Inability to cruise in layer
- Variable transition level due QNH

## Area QNH
- Must be set below transition layer
- Must be within 5hPa of aerodrome within 100nm
- Requesting area QNH from ATS (link flight following)

## Altimeter Setting on the Ground
- Use AWIS/ATIS to set QNH, otherwise set aerodrome elevation on altimeter to get QNH

## Instrument Approach Corrections for QNH
- Ability to reduce published minima in shaded grey boxes by 100ft with actual QNH
- Leave grey boxes as is for TAF QNH
- Add 50ft to grey boxes for Area QNH
