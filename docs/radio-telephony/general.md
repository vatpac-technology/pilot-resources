## Reporting Requirements
Pilots are expected to make reports to ATC in the following scenarios:

### Controlled Airspace
- Ready to Taxi
- Airborne
- Departure
- Position Report when not identified
- Updated Position Report, when previous estimate is more than **2 minutes** in error
- Sustained variation of more than **10kt** or **Mach 0.02** from any previously notified speed or any standard descent profile
- Aircraft performance is degraded
- Leaving a level or reaching an assigned level
- Unable to comply with ATC clearances or instructions
- Before leaving controlled airspace ondescent
- Arrival

### IFR Aircraft in Class G Airspace
- Taxiing (or Airborne if no VHF coverage on ground)
- Departure
- Reaching cruising level (if not identified)
- Position Report when not identified
- Updated Position Report, when previous estimate is more than **2 minutes** in error
- Before changing level
- Before changing frequency
- Requiring clearance in to CTA
- Before changing to CTAF and not monitoring ATS frequency on COMM2
- Arrival, to cancel SARWATCH

## Position Reports
When not identified on Radar or ADSB, Pilots must provide position reports to update ATC on their estimated location. This can be expected at low altitude in remote areas, and over the ocean. ATC will tell aircraft when they are identified, usually immediately upon departure.

### Format
- Callsign
- "Position"
- Significant Point
- Time
- Level/Altitude, (or "Left" last level vacated if on climb/descent)
- Climbing/Descending to (Assigned level) (if applicable)
- Next Significant point
- Estimated time over
- Ensuing significant point
- "Next"

!!! example
    **QFA123**: "QFA123, Position"  
    **Brisbane Radio**: "QFA123"  
    **QFA123**: "QFA123, Position MIKEG time 17, Flight level 370, Estimating OMKIN time 05, DADLU Next"  
    **Brisbane Radio**: "QFA123"  



## Readback Requirements
The following items are mandatory to read back to ATC:  

- An ATC Route Clearance in its entirety, and any amendments
- Holding instructions
- Any route and runway-holding position specified in a taxi clearance
- Any clearances, conditional clearances or instructions to hold short of, enter, land on, line-up on, wait, take-off from, cross, taxi or backtrack on, any runway or helipad
- Any approach clearance
- Any assigned runway or helipad
- Altimeter settings directed to specific aircraft (Not general broadcasts)
- SSR codes
- Level instructions (including ‘VIA SID/STAR TO’ when this is part of the instruction), direction of turn, heading and speed instructions

!!! note
    This is the complete list of readback requirements. Anything not listed above is **not required** to be read back. Some examples of items that aren't required to be read back are:

    - Report requests by ATC
    - Traffic Statements
    - Runway/Approach Expectations
    - General broadcasts
