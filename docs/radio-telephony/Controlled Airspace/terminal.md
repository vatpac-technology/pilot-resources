## Class C
### First Contact
On first contact with a terminal controller (generally 'Approach' or 'Departures'), **inbound** aircraft must report their assigned level, in-flight conditions, and the ATIS identifier.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>ATC Unit</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Cleared Level</span>, <span class='optional'>[Visual]</span>, received <span class='placeholder'>ATIS Code</span>"

!!! example
    "Sydney Approach, QFA426, descending to `A090`, received Delta"

On first contact with a terminal controller, **outbound** aircraft must report their passing level, assigned level, and assigned heading/departure instructions (if applicable).

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>ATC Unit</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='optional'>[<span class='placeholder'>Departure Instructions</span>]</span>, passing <span class='placeholder'>Passing Level</span>, climbing to <span class='placeholder'>Assigned Level</span>"

!!! example
    "Melbourne Departures, QLK78D, turning right heading 320, passing `A023`, climbing to `A050`"

#### Heavy/Super Categories
Aircraft in the Heavy or Super categories must append their callsign with their wake turbulence category during the initial call with each Approach, Departures, and Director controller.

!!! example
    **QFA12**: "Sydney Approach, SIA213 Super, descending to `A100`, received Golf"

The category is not required during any subsequent call.

### SIDs/STARs
Aircraft on a SID/STAR will generally be given climb/descent instructions using *'climb via SID to (Level)'* and *'descend via STAR to (Level)'* phraseology. Pilots must readback the instruction exactly as it is issued. Once all height/speed restrictions have been passed, controllers may use traditional climb/descent phraseology.

!!! warning "Important"
    If an aircraft is cleared via a SID or STAR and the controller issues a climb or descent without the *'climb via SID'* or '*descend via STAR'* phraseology, this does **not** cancel any applicable SID/STAR restrictions. Pilots must continue to comply with all speed, level, and lateral tracking restrictions on the procedure.

!!! example
    "JST881, climb via SID to `F280`"

#### Cancelling Restrictions
Where a controller wishes to cancel the published altitude restrictions on a SID/STAR, they will use the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, cancel level restrictions"

Where a controller wishes to cancel the published speed restrictions on a SID/STAR, they will use the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, cancel speed restrictions"

### Approaches
#### Instrument Approaches
Aircraft cleared for an instrument approach in CTA will be issued a clearance of the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, cleared <span class='placeholder'>Approach Type</span> approach runway <span class='placeholder'>Runway Number</span>"

!!! example
    "QJE1535, cleared ILS approach runway 27"

#### DGAs
Aircraft cleared for a DGA in CTA will be issued a clearance of the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, cleared <span class='optional'>[DME or GNSS]</span> arrival <span class='optional'>[sector <span class='placeholder'>Sector Letter</span>]</span>"

!!! example
    "QLK72, cleared DME arrival sector Bravo"

#### Visual Approaches
Aircraft cleared for a visual approach in CTA will be issued a clearance of the following format.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='optional'>[<span class='placeholder'>Circuit Join Instructions</span>]</span>, cleared visual approach <span class='optional'>[tracking via the STAR]</span>"

It is important to note the difference between a **join** instruction and a **track to** instruction.

| Instruction | Meaning |
| ---- | --- |
| **Join** final | Continue on your cleared track until within 5nm of the aerodrome (by day), then join final |
| **Track to** final | Track now from your present position direct to the final leg of the circuit |

!!! example
    "RXA4847, join downwind runway 05, cleared visual approach"  

    "QFA881, cleared visual approach tracking via the STAR"  

    "LKU, track to a 5nm final, cleared visual approach"

#### Leaving CTA
At aerodromes with low overlying CTA (like YMAV during tower closed operations), the terminal controller will issue a clearance to leave CTA on descent via the instrument approach. As with any other approach clearance, this constitutes a clearance to *re-enter* CTA following the published missed approach in the event of a go around.

!!! example
    "JST607, cleared to leave controlled airspace descending via the ILS approach runway 18, no reported IFR traffic, report clear of the runway"

## Procedural Class D
### Inbound Call
On first contact with a procedural approach unit (e.g. procedural towers), report your position, assigned level, in-flight conditions, and the ATIS identifer.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>ATC Unit</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Distance</span> miles <span class='placeholder'>Aerodrome Name</span>, <span class='placeholder'>GNSS Track/VOR Radial</span>, <span class='placeholder'>Assigned Level</span>, <span class='optional'>\[Visual]</span>, <span class='placeholder'>ATIS Code</span>"

!!! example
    "YCFS Tower, RXA6416, 32 miles Coffs Harbour on the 189 radial, descending to `A080`, visual, received Oscar"

### Departure Report
Once established on your outbound track (or in compliance with your assigned departure procedure), report your departure to the tower controller.

!!! note "Format"
    "<span class='placeholder'>Callsign</span>, tracking <span class='optional'>[<span class='placeholder'>Outbound Track</span> or via <span class='placeholder'>SID</span>]</span>, climbing to <span class='placeholder'>Assigned Level</span>"

!!! example
    "RXA6417, tracking 203, climbing to `A070`"  

    "XEB, tracking via the DUGGI ONE departure, climbing to `A070`"

### Approaches
There is no difference in phraseology used to clear an aircraft for an approach in Class C or Class D airspace, however due to airspace and surveillance coverage constraints, the controller may issue additional report requirements and/or clear aircraft to leave and re-enter CTA on descent prior to commencing the approach.

See [Class C](#approaches) for radio phraseology.
